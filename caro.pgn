1. e4 { Welcome to the wonderful world of the Caro-Kann. It is one of the 'Big four' defences against 1. e4 (the others being the French, Sicilian and ...e5) , but until recently has always been rather in their shadow. As sharper variations get refuted, or analysed out to a draw though, the Caro has emerged more and more as a serious winning attempt for Black. Let's look at the starting moves. } { White starts by staking a direct claim in the centre. Left to his own devices, he will consolidate it with 2. d4 (and perhaps c4 and f4 as well) . Black can try conceding the centre and nibbling away at it hypermodern style, but if he wants to contest it head on he has to challenge at least one of these pawns. } c6 {[%mdl 32768]} { In the French and the Caro-Kann, Black chooses to challenge the White e- pawn with his d- pawn. Like the Slav and the QGD, these are 'light square' openings. Typically they tend to be solid, but often concede White some kind of space advantage. They are also often associated with a struggle to find a good home for the 'bad' Black light square bishop.

Black could play 1...d5 straight away and liquidate the centre - the Scandinavian defence. Instead, he prefaces the move with ...c6, hoping to keep a pawn on the d5 square, or, in the case of the classical to gain time hunting down a knight on e4. After ...dxe4, Nxe4 . } 
2. d4 { White can duck the challenge with 2. d3, or 2. Nc3 and 3. Nf3, but the critical lines stem from 2 d4. } d5 { And after d5, White has a choice: He can support the centre with f3, but this is awkward. He can support the e- pawn with a knight on c3 or d2 , but then Black exchanges and gains time on the knight on e4 . With the centre open, his light square bishop has a relatively easy time developing, and although White gets to tickle it for a few moves it usually ends up swapped off for its valuable counterpart. Black then puts his pawns on light squares, and all his pieces are good.

Most challenging, these days is for White to respond with e4 - e5. Black then has two major attempts - he can immediately attack the centre with c6- c5, or he can develop the bishop with Bf5 and hope to follow up with e6, knights somewhere, and eventually c5 and/or f6 breaks. Both approaches are viable. The closed } { Bf5 } { lines are thematically richer though, and more theory intense. They are traditionally regarded as the 'main' lines, and the ones I have chosen to examine here.

Black's bishop develops quickly to f5 , but it is far from 'safe'. White tries all sorts of different means to try to exploit it as exposed. Meanwhile, he can try to cramp Black, and eventually attack him on the kingside (with h4 and g4 or f4, g4 and f5) , the queenside (with a4) or in the centre (with c4, especially once Black has played ...c5 himself) .

If White doesn't play actively however, and especially if he exchanges his light squared bishop for no good reason, he can find his position lifeless and often drifting into significantly worse. This is particularity common in low level chess, where if anything Black outscores White in this opening. }

1. e4 c6 
2. d4 d5 
3. e5 {[%cal Bc8f5,Bc6c5]} { A few decades ago the advance variation was seen as eccentric and harmless; a poor relation to the advance French. And this can be the case if White plays without a clear plan in mind; in particular, if he mindlessly swaps his light squared bishop without a concrete reason he can drift into a worse position very easily - Black will play c5 and have easy pressure on d4 and e5 for no real compensation, while White's dark square bishop can be bad.

These days however, the advance is seen as the critical test. White has some concrete ideas and Black needs to know some theory to meet them.

A number of books recommend systems with }Bf5 {[%mdl 32768]} ( 3...c5 { here. It is a good alternative to the 'main' lines, and works especially well if White avoids the critical 4 } { dxc5 . After 4.dxc5 , 4...e6 is a good move, though beware 5.a3 . } ) { But I have tried in vain to get } { 3...c5 4.dxc5 Nc6 to work. The rarely played thus far! 5.f4 seems to be seriously better for White. } {

So I have opted for the traditional main line, } { 3...Bf5 .

The apparently tame looking approach, with Nf3 , Be2 and O-O is the current main line. It is the brain child of Nigel Short, and bears his name. It is also a favourite of the Leela bot.

Short's original interpretation used to involve the c3 move, but the modern approach is more flexible and will often involve early breaks with c4 - especially when Black starts to open the position himself. So Black needs to be careful.

Still, Black has numerous options against the Short system. 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 c5 is a big one; 3.Bf5 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 Ne7 with the idea of 6.O-O c5 is very popular at the moment. } { The combination Nd7, Ne7 and h6 could make a reasonable claim to being the third 'main line', and it is what we will look at here. } 
4. Nf3 e6 
5. Be2 {[%cal Bg8e7,Bb8d7,Bh7h6,Bf5h7,Gc2c4,Ge1g1,Gb1d2,Gd2b3]} { It is worth thinking about the practical effects of Black's space disadvantage here. It causes 4 niggling problems: The difficulty in finding good squares for all his pieces, particularly his king's knight; the vulnerability of his light squared bishop to attack; the occasional weakness of the queenside due to the absence of the bishop; and a delay in development as he tries to solve these problems.

So Black needs to gain some space somewhere. The trouble is, any attempt to do so tends to open things up for White's better placed pieces. White on the other hand has two conflicting goals of his own - he'd like to keep Black as bottled up as possible, but he'd also like to open things up so that these well placed pieces of his can actually get at some targets. In practice this usually means a break with c4 and or f4- f5. And when Black is opening the position, White needs to respond vigorously.

If Black manages to solve the problems above, then a lingering White space advantage does not tend to cause him undue problems.

For example, here is an early treatment of the Short system: }Nd7 ( 5...c5 6.O-O { (Be3! with the idea of an early c4 break is much more testing) } { Nc6 7.c3 cxd4 8.cxd4 Nge7 9.Nc3 Nc8! (Black solves the problem of his king's knight) 10.Be3 Nb6 11.Rc1 Be7 } ) { and Black is fine. } 
6. O-O h6 {[%cal Bf5h7,Bg7g5]} { Making a retreat square for the light square bishop, but also often associated with a more enterprising idea. } 
7. Nbd2 {[%cal Gd2b3,Gc1d2,Ga1c1,Gc2c4]} { White's standard deployment in these lines is N-d2-b3 to clamp the c5 square, along with Bd2 and possibly Rc1 and/or Ba5. } Ne7 
8. Nb3 g5 { 8...Bh7 is also very popular and playable too. But g5 is the main line here, despite its initially odd appearance. } 
9. Ne1 {[%cal Gf2f4,Rg5g4,Ge1d3][%csl Gc5]} { White routes his knight to d3 , dodging any ...g4 hits, further clamping c5 and freeing his f- pawn. } Qc7 
10. Nd3 {[%cal Gd3c5,Gb3c5][%csl Rc5]} b6 { Alternatively, Black can play ...Ng6 here, and if Ne1 (threatening g4, winning the bishop on f5) , ... Ne7 with a repetition.

If he doesn't want that, he needs to keep the White knights out of c5. O-O-O for instance would be a mistake because of Ndc5. } 
11. Be3 Bg7 
{ White decides not to leave Black quietly to his own devices. Play gets very sharp now; there have been a number of very high level games, almost all of them ending in draws. At lower levels though, this is very much 'three results' chess. } 12. f4 c5 
13. dxc5 gxf4

15. Bxf4 Ng6 {[%cal Bg6f4]} 
16. Bg3 O-O

1. e4 c6 {[%mdl 32768]} 
2. d4 d5 
3. e5 { I have made no secret of the fact that I regard 3. e5 as the critical test of the Caro-Kann, and the Short system as probably the nastiest version for Black to face. }Bf5 ( 3...c5 { is a good alternative here, providing you follow up } 4.dxc5 { with } { e6! I couldn't make 4...Nc6?! work and I really don't trust it at all. } ) {

But I chose Bf5 lines because they were more historically popular, and very instructive for the Caro as a whole. } 
4. Nf3 { Unpretentious and nasty. } ( 4.h4 { would be the other really critical test, but the line with } 4...h5 5.Bd3 Bxd3 6.Qxd3 e6 7.Bg5 Be7! { seems to more or less neutralise it. } ) e6 
5. Be2 { White keeps his 'good' bishop and relies on his space; he can later break with c4, or (king's knight moves and then) f4/g4/f5. Black can actually have considerable trouble adequately completing his development. } Nd7 { 5... Nd7 has been the most popular here, though in high level play it has been superseded by 5...Ne7. More on this later.

} ( 5...c5 { is sharp and direct here and has always enjoyed a fair following. It can work well if White doesn't know what he's doing. If he does? Not so much. } 6.Be3! { is critical and now Black has two major lines: } 6...cxd4 7.Nxd4 Ne7 8.O-O Nbc6 9.Bb5 a6 10.Bxc6 Nxc6 11.Nxf5 exf5 ) { or } ( 5...c5 6.Be3 Qb6 { (sharpest) } 7.Nc3! Nc6 { and now } 8.Na4! { , } { 8.O-O and 8.dxc5 are all sharp, dangerous and score well for White in practice at all levels. Playable, but lots of theory to learn if you want to make this work and there will be concrete theoretical problems you have to solve. Not something I wanted to recommend, especially in a starter kit! } ) {

} ( 5...Ne7 { often just transposes to the main line, but has a major branch, trying to get an improved version of the early } { c5 lines. 6.O-O (Be3 would not be well placed if Black switches back to playing 'normally) c5!? is met by 7.c4! Nc6 and now 8.Na3! or 8.dxc5!? } ) { Playable, interesting and respectable, but a lot of concrete stuff to learn, and once again, White scores well in practice. } 
6. O-O Ne7 { Most common in praxis, though I gave } ( 6...h6 { in the original recommendation. That will usually transpose, and it cuts out lines with } { Nh4 . White could though try to exploit it with 7.b3 Ne7 8.c4 . This is perhaps more dangerous than I originally thought; in practice, Black has done ok with 8...Bh7 9.Nc3 Nf5 , or 8...Ng6 - whether or not I really trust it is another matter. } ) 
7. Nbd2 ( 7.Nh4 { tries to exploit this move order. Black has most commonly meekly retreated with Bg6 , but } 7...c5! 8.c3 Be4! 9.Nd2 Nc6! { seems pretty decent. } ) h6 { There are alternatives here. People have tried } ( 7...c5 { , and generally been hacked up by } 8.c4 { . This doesn't seem to be a good time for that move. } ) {

} ( 7...Nc8 { would be nice if it worked - Black lets his king's bishop out and hopes to maybe move the knight again to } { b6 . White can ask some questions with the rare 8. c4 (or) 8. b3 , but the most obvious problem is simply 8.a4! Be7 (a5 would be weakening) 9.a5 +=, and while the bishop on e7 might be happy, the knight on c8 isn't. This was an early approach which is now mostly out of favour. } ) {

There are also minor lines like } ( 7...Bg6 ) { or } ( 7...Ng6 ) { - these don't really cause White any problems, and he is usually comforatbly better with his normal plan of Nb3, Bd2, Rc1 and c4.

But 7... h6 is clearly useful, we should be happy with it. } 
8. Nb3 ( 8.c3 { does ok, but we should be fine after } 8...Bh7 { or } { 8...g5

} ) ( 8.a4 { is an interesting sideline; White has done well against normal play (g5 or Bh7) (by pushing on to) a5 (. But it neglects to clamp the) c5 square, and } 8...c5! 9.dxc5 Nc6 10.Nb3 Nxc5 { is a good answer. } ) g5 { This is the move that a lot of newcomers to the Caro don't like. It seems to be contrary to the 'safe and solid, if slightly worse' spirit of the opening. But sometimes we just have to 'suck it up' and reconcile ourselves to playing good moves!

8...g5 is the most commonly played move, the computer's favourite, and scores well. It holds the glimmer of an attack on the White king, and clamps down to some extent on White ideas of playing f4, but mostly it is about gaining some much needed space to deal with the kingside log jam.

If you look at computer alternatives, you usually find they want to play ...g5 in a few moves anyway. But the move isn't strictly forced - we don't have to play it. Let's see what happens if we don't.

} ( 8...Bg6 ) { and } ( 8...Ng6 ) { simply aren't up to the task for the same reason as usual. Moves like } ( 8...a6 ) ( 8...Rc8 ) ( 8...Bg4 ) { etc do ok some times, but their only real merit is to get the opponent out of book.

} ( 8...Qc7 { is playable, and can be followed up with } 9.Bd2 a5!? 10.a4 { - but then it is probably best to play } 10...g5 { anyway. Everyone actually does. } ) {

} ( 8...Nc8 { might not be so bad here. } 9.a4 a5 { has been tried a few times - Artemiev and Akobian have both won games like this recently. Most games have continued } 10.Bd2 { (natural, but not necessarily best) } { Be7 11.Rc1 (I really don't like this one) O-O and Black is more or less ok. But I have trust issues. For instance, 10.Be3 may be better than Bd2 . And rather than 11.Rc1?! , White could try the immediate 11. c4. } ) {

If you play this line there is another nasty little thing you have to watch out for: } ( 8...Nc8 9.a4 a5 10.Bd2 Be7 11.Ne1!? O-O?? { (Black has to play c5!) } 12.Bd3!! Bxd3 13.Nxd3 { , and with Qg4 (and) f4-f5 (coming Black is already busted.) } ) {

} ( 8...Bh7!? { is the 'big' main alternative here. The idea is to play } { Nf5 or Ng6 , Be7 and hopefully O-O . The trouble is, it also gives White time to do everything he wants. For example, 9.Bd2 Ng6 (slightly more popular than Nf5, which runs into eventual g4 hits) and now White has a wide choice - 10.Rc1 , 10.c4 and especially 10.g3 are all annoying. } ) { Alternatively, plans with } ( 8...Bh7 9.a4! { are also good enough for an edge. } ) {

In summary - 8...Bh7 is playable - but it certainly won't encourage you to look forward to meeting the Short variation. Solid but suffering will very much be the order of the day. } 
9. Ne1 { White tries } ( 9.a4 { first sometimes. you can block it with } 9...a5 { or simply ignore it with 9... Bg7 (and castle) } ) { . } Qc7 { Note, } ( 9...Bg7 ?! { is badly timed here. We need to keep looking at the c5 square just a little bit longer. } 10.f4! { exploits that error and while it is too early to say that Black is getting hacked up, he is certainly being attacked before he has got his counter play properly organised. } ) 
10. Nd3 { So, f4 is now prepared and Nc5 threatened. } ( { The immediate } 10.f4 { is not so good, as we have } 10...c5! { , leading to Black wins in various recent games including Motylev - Ding, Bologan - Eljanov and Shirov - Nakamura. } ) {

However, now Nc5 can be an issue. What do we do about it? } Ng6 { This is an attractive solution. We simply ignore it. And we intend to go queenside. In the original main line, I gave } ( 10...b6 11.Be3 Bg7 ) { which also scores pretty decently (better than 50%) , but not as well.

} ( { The problem with } 10...Ng6 { is that White has a forced draw. } 11.Ne1! { threatens 12. g4 Be4 13. f3 trapping the bishop. Black has no option other than going back with } 11...Ne7 { , after which White plays } 12.Nd3 { again, and Black either reverts to the } { b6 line, or agrees the draw. } ) { If White is feeling more aggressive though there is an interesting struggle ahead. } 
11. Be3 O-O-O 
12. Ne1 ( { The engine Leela find the interesting } 12.Bg4 { and claims a small White edge. } ) Ne7 { Even with opposite side castling, you still don't want your bishop trapped. } 
13. a4 Kb8 ( { You could make an argument for } 13...f6 { , 13...Be4 (or) 13...Bg7 (here.) } ) 
14. a5 a6 { This is unclear. Black's pieces can't easily get at White's king at the moment; his plan is to play ...f6.

White on the other hand has grabbed some space on the queenside, but it is not exactly clear how he is going to continue his attack either. I suspect Black's position is actually a little easier to play.

So, in summary: Don't be scared of g5! It is a good move, and Black scores well with it. It also has another virtue- it is very 'move order proof'. If you choose something else you may have problems if White fiddles with his orders, and end up outside our repertoire.

But if you are looking for a respectable alternative, you could investigate 8...Nc8, or one of the early ...c5 systems. Both 5...c5 and 5...Ne7, 6...c5 have good theoretical reputations, if not practical scores. Though you'll have to work. Alternatively there is 3...c5. It has had good coverage in recent books by Houska, Shaw (from the White side) and Fernadez (available here in chessable as it happens) .

Good luck! }

I think Seirawan's recent strategy course also featured a game in this line, or something very similar. } ) h6 ( 6...h5 { is extremely rare here as Black would be handing over the } { g5 square. } )

So instead attention shifted to 11. Bd2, and it is currently the main line. } Ngf6 
12. O-O-O Be7 { In the old days Black used to castle queenside and was slightly worse. These days going kingside is much more popular. } 
13. Kb1 { The other big line, } ( 13.Ne4 { , can again be met by } 13...Qb6! 14.Nxf6 Nxf6 15.Ne5 Rd8 ) Qb6 ( 13...O-O { is the main move, but this scores much better. It has quite a clever little idea... } ) 
14. Rhe1 { So, here is the point. When Black plays 13 ... O-O, he has announced his King's home address perhaps a little early. White can set about trying to attack it, starting with Ne4 to free up his g- pawn. See the informational line following . He would very rarely play Rhe1.

After Qb6 however, the Black king obstinately stays in the centre. White can still try } ( 14.Ne4 { - and manages a paltry score of 35% when he does so. Black has two decent replies. Firstly, } 14...Nxe4 15.Qxe4 Nf6 16.Qe2 Qb5! { offering a trade you sometimes see in the } { Qa5 Scandinavian. After 17.Qxb5 cxb5 } ) { Black's pawn structure looks odd but he has a real clamp on the light squares. More commonly, he simply plays } ( 14.Ne4 Rd8 { , and White only scores 27%! - his most common try is } 15.Nxf6+ Nxf6 16.Qe2 { but then Black has either } 16...Qb5 { again, or } { 16...c5 . } ) { It might be hard to claim that Black is actually better, but his position does seem easier to play.

So, instead, White normally tries to get at the king in the centre - with moves which may not be so useful if Back changes direction and castles. The main candidates are } ( 14.c4 ) { and } ( 14.Rhe1 ) {

Rhe1 looks clever because it appears to set a trap: If (when) Black castles, he has Nf5, winning 'the bishop and the pawn structure'. However, Black can happily 'fall into it', and practice seems to show that in the resulting position he is not just equal, but better!

} ( 14.c4 { is met by } 14...O-O 15.Ne4 { or 15.Bf4 Rad8 16.Qc2 Rfe8 } 15...Rad8 ) { . Again, White scores considerably below 50% - his attack comes slightly slower than in the main line, and he has weakened his own king. } O-O 
15. Nf5 {[%cal Ge1e7]} exf5 
16. Rxe7 Qd8 {[%cal Gd8e7,Gf6e4]} 
17. Re2 ( 17.Rde1 { wins control of the e- file.... but it costs the exchange after } 17...Ne4 { . } ) Ne4 {[%cal Gg2g4]} { Black's knight is trying to claim it is at least as strong as White's rather wretched bishop.

Undermining it immediately with }
18.-- ( 18.g4? { fails after the simple } ) ( 18.Nxd2+ { and } { 19.fxg4 } ) { So White normally plays } ( 18.Bc1 { , after which a typical sequence is } 18...Re8 19.g4 fxg4 20.Rxe4 Rxe4 21.Qxe4 Nf6 22.Qe5 gxf3 23.Rg1 Kh8 ) {

Another try is } ( 18.g3 Ndf6 19.Nh4 Qd7 20.Qf3 { but both } 20...Qxd4 { and } { 20...Qd5 } ) { then seem to work out well for Black.

White's best try is probably } ( 18.Bf4! Ndf6 19.Ne5 { . Black then can (and probably should) claim 'Greed is good! and play } 19...Nxh5 { After } 20.Bc1 Nhf6 21.g4 { , he counter attacks with } 21...c5 { and has been willing to test out the pawns vs piece endgame that arises after } 22.f3 Qxd4 23.Qxd4 cxd4 24.fxe4 fxe4 25.Rxd4  { A particularly tricky weapon for speed chess. } )

I suspect this is mostly due to the attitude of the players - Caro players being quite interested in the finesses of their opening, while most Rubinstein players are more looking to dodge theory and muddle through. The real Rubinstein experts like Meier do pretty well.

Anyway, although Nd7 has been rather eclipsed by Bf5, it is alive and well and has been played by the world's best. It was a big favourite of Karpov and has been the subject of an excellent recent book by Fernandez - available here on chessable.

It has one advantage that is often underestimated. Black's wins often comes slowly - White's edge drifts away and he often goes home grumpy thinking 'I just didn't play that well this evening'. It can be very hard to spot his mistakes, and very hard to force himself to analyse the game properly.

Simplifications tend to favour Black, but the next ten or twenty moves might be a bit uncomfortable.

Black's dream would be an ending with a knight against a lone White dark square bishop, locked in by a pawn on d4. Capablanca has shown that even that sort of ending can be tenable. White's dream would be a dashing mating attack, often aided by a d4-d5 break (or sacrifice) . This is a constant threat in these isolated queen pawn lines, and annoyingly, when they work they can be devastating, but when they fail White often escapes with an (albeit rather stale) equality.

15. Qxc7+ Kxc7 {[%csl Ge5]} { You may wonder about White's bishop pair and kingside space. Doesn't he have an edge here?

Perhaps. But Black's bishop is good and he has a strong e5 square (he's going to want to put his pieces there if possible rather than a pawn) . If a few more pieces come off we can start calling this an ending rather than a queenless middlegame, in which case the Black king is better placed than White's (more centralised) . Black can also try to play against White's kingside, claiming that while his pawns grant space they may in fact be slightly over extended.

Convinced? I'm not even really sure about this line myself. But I can point out the high score it has achieved so far in practice. }

It is almost as if he is playing the White side of a Ruy Lopez or Pirc position. The position is relatively static and both sides will probably be making 'small' improving moves - for Black that could include ...a4, ...h6, ...Qc7 etc

White's best chance on the other hand is probably to admit that he is slightly worse and equalise with 10 d4. After that Black can play 10...ed 11 Nxd4 and then say Ne5 and he is fine. Not really what White wants to do though. KIA players love their autopilot, and are itching to play h4, Nf1 etc. We should be well placed against this. }
