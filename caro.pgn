{ Welcome to the wonderful world of the Caro-Kann. It is one of the 'Big four' defences against 1. e4 (the others being the French, Sicilian and ...e5), but until recently has always been rather in their shadow. As sharper variations get refuted, or analysed out to a draw though, the Caro has emerged more and more as a serious winning attempt for Black. Let's look at the starting moves. White starts by staking a direct claim in the centre. Left to his own devices, he will consolidate it with 2. d4 (and perhaps c4 and f4 as well). Black can try conceding the centre and nibbling away at it hypermodern style, but if he wants to contest it head on he has to challenge at least one of these pawns. } 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 { And after d5, White has a choice: He can support the centre with f3, but this is awkward. He can support the e- pawn with a knight on c3 or d2 , but then Black exchanges and gains time on the knight on e4 . With the centre open, his light square bishop has a relatively easy time developing, and although White gets to tickle it for a few moves it usually ends up swapped off for its valuable counterpart. Black then puts his pawns on light squares, and all his pieces are good. Most challenging, these days is for White to respond with e4 - e5. Black then has two major attempts - he can immediately attack the centre with c6- c5, or he can develop the bishop with Bf5 and hope to follow up with e6, knights somewhere, and eventually c5 and/or f6 breaks. Both approaches are viable. The closed Bf5 lines are thematically richer though, and more theory intense. They are traditionally regarded as the 'main' lines, and the ones I have chosen to examine here. Black's bishop develops quickly to f5 , but it is far from 'safe'. White tries all sorts of different means to try to exploit it as exposed. Meanwhile, he can try to cramp Black, and eventually attack him on the kingside (with h4 and g4 or f4, g4 and f5), the queenside (with a4) or in the centre (with c4, especially once Black has played ...c5 himself). If White doesn't play actively however, and especially if he exchanges his light squared bishop for no good reason, he can find his position lifeless and often drifting into significantly worse. This is particularity common in low level chess, where if anything Black outscores White in this opening. } *

But sometimes we just have to 'suck it up' and reconcile ourselves to playing good moves! 8...g5 is the most commonly played move, the computer's favourite, and scores well. It holds the glimmer of an attack on the White king, and clamps down to some extent on White ideas of playing f4, but mostly it is about gaining some much needed space to deal with the kingside log jam. If you look at computer alternatives, you usually find they want to play ...g5 in a few moves anyway. But the move isn't strictly forced - we don't have to play it. Let's see what happens if we don't. and simply aren't up to the task for the same reason as usual. Moves like etc do ok some times, but their only real merit is to get the opponent out of book.

Black's pieces can't easily get at White's king at the moment; his plan is to play ...f6. White on the other hand has grabbed some space on the queenside, but it is not exactly clear how he is going to continue his attack either. I suspect Black's position is actually a little easier to play. So, in summary: Don't be scared of g5! It is a good move, and Black scores well with it. It also has another virtue- it is very 'move order proof'. If you choose something else you may have problems if White fiddles with his orders, and end up outside our repertoire. But if you are looking for a respectable alternative, you could investigate 8...Nc8, or one of the early ...c5 systems. Both 5...c5 and 5...Ne7, 6...c5 have good theoretical reputations, if not practical scores. Though you'll have to work. Alternatively there is 3...c5. It has had good coverage in recent books by Houska, Shaw (from the White side) and Fernadez (available here in chessable as it happens). Good luck! } *

But Black's bishop is good and he has a strong e5 square (he's going to want to put his pieces there if possible rather than a pawn). If a few more pieces come off we can start calling this an ending rather than a queenless middlegame, in which case the Black king is better placed than White's (more centralised). Black can also try to play against White's kingside, claiming that while his pawns grant space they may in fact be slightly over extended. Convinced? I'm not even really sure about this line myself. But I can point out the high score it has achieved so far in practice. } *

It is almost as if he is playing the White side of a Ruy Lopez or Pirc position. The position is relatively static and both sides will probably be making 'small' improving moves - for Black that could include ...a4, ...h6, ...Qc7 etc White's best chance on the other hand is probably to admit that he is slightly worse and equalise with 10 d4. After that Black can play 10...ed 11 Nxd4 and then say Ne5 and he is fine. Not really what White wants to do though. KIA players love their autopilot, and are itching to play h4, Nf1 etc. We should be well placed against this. } *
